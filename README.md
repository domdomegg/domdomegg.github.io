This repository builds the static Next.js site available at [adamjones.me](https://adamjones.me).

The domain is held in [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/).

On 2023-03-07 this repository was made open-source. As I wasn't certain that there was nothing sensitive in the repo, I broke the Git history here. The old history is available in [domdomegg/domdomegg.github.io-archive](https://github.com/domdomegg/domdomegg.github.io-archive).
