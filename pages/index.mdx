## bio

**Adam Jones** is working to make the transition to advanced AI systems go well. He's currently a member of technical staff at [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com), helping develop [the Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

Previously, he led AI safety talent programs at [BlueDot Impact](https://bluedot.org), inculding the large-scale AI Safety Fundamentals courses. He also advised the [UK Government's Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-science-innovation-and-technology) on AI safety policy.

{/*  https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=aws-ses-v2-local&from=2021-11-01 */}
Outside of work, he enjoys making things! This includes writing [blog articles](/blog) (mainly about AI safety) and building popular open-source tools: [his AWS Email Simulator](https://github.com/domdomegg/aws-ses-v2-local) has over 1 million downloads, [his YouTube thumbnail-hiding browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hide-youtube-thumbnails/phmcfcbljjdlomoipaffekhgfnpndbef/reviews) serves 30,000+ weekly users, and [his Airtable MCP server](https://github.com/domdomegg/airtable-mcp-server) has spurred 60 forks. Finally, he also contributes media to Wikimedia Commons, with his work appearing in [textbooks](https://dinwiddiehighschool.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/grd-11-textbook.pdf#page=12), [academic papers](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac278), and [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=10&v=w_CYwd6cHUA) with millions of views.

When not making new things, he enjoys co-operative board games, video games, sunny weather, and [playing capture the flag on Hampstead Heath](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJ0H-xTow9C/).

## projects

- [AWS Email Simulator](https://github.com/domdomegg/aws-ses-v2-local): enables devs to test emails without AWS credentials, and work productively without internet. Downloaded over 1 million times. {/* https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=aws-ses-v2-local&from=2021-11-01 */}
- [YouTube thumbnail hider](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hide-youtube-thumbnails/phmcfcbljjdlomoipaffekhgfnpndbef): browser extension with >30,000 weekly active users and [100+ 5-star reviews](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hide-youtube-thumbnails/phmcfcbljjdlomoipaffekhgfnpndbef/reviews).
- [Serverless offline watcher](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-offline-watcher): developer tool that enables extending the Serverless framework with arbitrary file or directory hooks.

- [PDF scanner](./pdf-scanner): add a scanned look to documents, more convincingly than existing services.
- [RSA SecurID library](https://github.com/domdomegg/rsa-securid): reverse-engineered security token generator, derived from a C library. Also available as an easy-to-use [browser extension](https://github.com/domdomegg/rsa-securid-browser-extension).
- [TypeScript i18n library](https://github.com/domdomegg/ts-i18n): A lightweight, flexible, and fully type-safe translation framework for websites, native apps and servers.
- [Google Doc to LaTeX](./gdoc2latex-gui): Converter that makes writing LaTeX a piece of cake.
- [Discord reminder bot template](https://github.com/domdomegg/discord-reminder-template): send reminders from GitHub. 2 min setup.

- Media: I publish [free-cultural works](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/freeworks/) on places like [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Domdomegg) (where I also helped build the [Android app](https://commons-app.github.io/)). They've ended up in [US state forestry manuals](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/102139/2020TreeStewardManualver03.pdf#page=8), [South African national textbooks](https://dinwiddiehighschool.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/grd-11-textbook.pdf#page=12), [papers on language models](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac278), and [YouTube videos with millions of views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=10&v=w_CYwd6cHUA).

Most of these have their source code availabile on [my GitHub](https://github.com/domdomegg). You can [contribute to support their development](./sponsor/).
