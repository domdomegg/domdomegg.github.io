## How am I spending my time?

As of April 2023, I'm:

- Developing the [Hypertune](https://www.hypertune.com) platform, that allows developers to quickly and easily make their applications configurable.
- Building software for [BlueDot Impact](https://bluedotimpact.org/) to improve programmes that support people into high-impact careers. At the moment, building tools to help facilitiate [networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_networking) amongst cohorts.
- Owning technology at [Raise](https://www.joinraise.org/), a movement to get people more engaged with charity. The big thing this month is sorting all the finance and accounting work now our donation pushes have ended at most chapters.

## I'm interested in

- Applying [effective alturism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) principles.
- Mitigating risks from [artificial intelligence](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/).
- Improving government services, particularly in local government.
- Self-improvement, particularly towards optimising happiness and productivity (in terms of outcomes rather than outputs).

## Featured projects

- [AWS Email Simulator](https://github.com/domdomegg/aws-ses-v2-local): enables devs to test emails without AWS credentials, and work productively without internet. Downloaded over 14,000 times.
- [YouTube thumbnail hider](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hide-youtube-thumbnails/phmcfcbljjdlomoipaffekhgfnpndbef): browser extension with thousands of weekly active users and plenty of glowing 5-star reviews.
- [Apply for a postal vote service](./postal-vote/): fully-working GOV.UK-style service. I think this is the first ever properly electronic version of this form.
- [Serverless offline watcher](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-offline-watcher): developer tool that enables extending the Serverless framework with arbitrary file or directory hooks.
- [London cycle parking](./london-cycle-parking/): find cycle parking quickly in London.
- [ISA tracking tool](https://github.com/domdomegg/halifax-share-dealing-sdk): compatible with 4 brokers for read _and write_ operations. Has reliably tracked my [ISA](https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts) performance every day for the last 3 years.
- [PDF scanner](./pdf-scanner): add a scanned look, more convincingly than existing services.
- [RSA SecurID library](https://github.com/domdomegg/rsa-securid): reverse-engineered security token generator, derived from a C library. Also available as an easy-to-use [browser extension](https://github.com/domdomegg/rsa-securid-browser-extension).
- [TypeScript i18n library](https://github.com/domdomegg/ts-i18n): A lightweight, flexible, and fully type-safe translation framework for websites, native apps and servers.
- [Google Doc to LaTeX](./gdoc2latex-gui): Converter that makes writing LaTeX a piece of cake. 
- [Discord reminder bot template](https://github.com/domdomegg/discord-reminder-template): send reminders from GitHub. 2 min setup.
- [Day visualiser](./oneday): ever felt you needed more existential dread in your life? See how fast the day is slipping away from you.
- Media: I publish [free-cultural works](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/freeworks/) on places like [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Domdomegg) (where I also helped build the [Android app](https://commons-app.github.io/)). They've ended up in [US state forestry manuals](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/102139/2020TreeStewardManualver03.pdf#page=8), [South African national textbooks](https://dinwiddiehighschool.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/grd-11-textbook.pdf#page=12), [papers on language models](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac278), and [YouTube videos with millions of views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=10&v=w_CYwd6cHUA).

Most of these have their source code availabile on [my GitHub](https://github.com/domdomegg).

## Communicating with me

From you to me:

- Please bias towards overcommunicating with me. Will interrupt you if you're telling me stuff I don't think is relevant.
- State your uncertainties and where you've made assumptions.
- Give me [feedback](./feedback). Prefer unpolished timely feedback to no or late feedback. Bonus points if you can be specific or provide examples.
- Prefers asynchronous communication. Dislikes surprise phone calls.
- Asynchronous: Slack if you know I check that workspace. WhatsApp, Messenger or Telegram for personal stuff, email for everything else.
  - If you need me to do or answer something, make it obvious.
    - Add '[Action required]' to the subject.
    - Prefix tasks with 'Action required:'.
    - State any relevant timelines upfront.
  - If I need to read it, use the email 'to' line or tag my Slack handle.
  - When writing something with multiple parts, give them unique numbers. This helps us refer back to them.
  - Don't [inline reply](https://ssw.com.au/rules/email-avoid-inline/) to emails. It's hard to see what's been added, muddies email history, and causes difficult-to-resolve forks.
  - [Don't just say hello](https://nohello.net/).
  - Where relevant, communicate widely (e.g. Slack channels/email distros, not DMs) so others can learn from our conversation later.
- Synchronous: In person, or [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/). Hates Webex and Lync.
- If you're asking me for a review, see my [review guide](./reviews).

From me to you:

- Will try to follow your communication preferences.
- I try to triage comms within 24 hours, and respond within 1 week. Slower when I'm extra busy. I don't usually send acknowledgement messages.
- [Assume misunderstanding, not malice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor). In particular:
    - If you think I'm going in the wrong direction, tell me early.
    - I err on the side of overcommunicating to ensure we're aligned. This can lead to overexplaining: if this is the case let me know!
    - If I am slow to respond, I'm likely just a bit overloaded with other stuff.
- ‚úÖ is 'done', üëç is 'acknowledged' ([not meant passive aggressively](https://www.cnet.com/culture/internet/gen-z-youll-have-to-pry-the-hostile-thumbs-up-emoji-from-my-old-dead-hands/))

## Other trivia

- Lives in [London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAusbJmRB0c). If you're around and would like to meet up, let me know!
- Enjoys getting around by bike, and will encourage you to give it a go. Happy to help find you a [good commuting route](https://www.cyclestreets.net/) and get you confident on the road.
