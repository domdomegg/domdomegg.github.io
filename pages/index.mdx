Previously, he led AI safety talent programs at [BlueDot Impact](https://bluedot.org), inculding the large-scale AI Safety Fundamentals courses. He also advised the [UK Government's Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-science-innovation-and-technology) on AI safety policy.

Outside of work, he enjoys making things! This includes writing [blog articles](/blog) (mainly about AI safety) and building popular open-source tools: [his AWS Email Simulator](https://github.com/domdomegg/aws-ses-v2-local) has over 1 million downloads, [his YouTube thumbnail-hiding browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hide-youtube-thumbnails/phmcfcbljjdlomoipaffekhgfnpndbef/reviews) serves 30,000+ weekly users, and [his Airtable MCP server](https://github.com/domdomegg/airtable-mcp-server) has spurred 60 forks. Finally, he also contributes media to Wikimedia Commons, with his work appearing in [textbooks](https://dinwiddiehighschool.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/grd-11-textbook.pdf#page=12), [academic papers](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac278), and [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=10&v=w_CYwd6cHUA) with millions of views.

When not making new things, he enjoys co-operative board games, video games, sunny weather, and [playing capture the flag on Hampstead Heath](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJ0H-xTow9C/).
