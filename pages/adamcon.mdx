# AdamCon

<blockquote className='border-red-600'>Where interesting people go to find other interesting people</blockquote>

Can you engineer the perfect day with friends? I'm not sure, but AdamCon is my attempt at making it happen.

AdamCon is a one-day event designed around meeting new people in booked 1:1 conversations. We expect 50-100 interesting people from Adam's extended network to attend - find your next best friend, partner, job, cofounder, or just someone to grab a drink with.

<Testimonial
  quote="After a previous conference I went to, I thought 'what if this, but for friendships?' and somehow convinced myself this was genius rather than unhinged. The worst case scenario is we stand around awkwardly for six hours. The best case is I accidentally create London's most chaotic friendship laboratory. Either way, I'm calling it a win."

## Other questions you might have

**Who's invited?**

AdamCon is open to anyone who wants to meet new people and have interesting conversations. If you know Adam, you should sign up! If you don't know Adam, but you like the sound of this, you should sign up too!

(You're also very welcome to send on this invite to friends, colleagues, or anyone else you think would enjoy it.)

**When do I need to register by?**

Registration closes when we hit capacity. Sign up early to avoid (severe) disappointment.

**How will the matching actually work?**

We'll either get/build a fancy booking platform or just have a Google Sheet with Calendlys - depends how many of you actually sign up.

**What if I don't know anyone?**

AdamCon is designed for people who want to meet new people! You'll be able to find others who are also looking to connect.

**What can I eat/drink?**

AdamCon won't be providing food or drinks, so feel free to bring your own or grab something nearby! There's a ton of great options in and around the National Theatre.

**I have other decision-relevant questions!**

Contact [Adam](/). Or just sign up and wing it.
