Thank you for considering supporting my work! This lists a few ways you can help.

### Use it for good

I build things hoping they'll be useful. Go build things, help people, make the world slightly better. If my software plays a small part in that, I'm glad.

### Say thanks

You can [send me positive feedback](../feedback/), or [email me at the details on my homepage](../). For some software you can also leave a positive review or star the GitHub repository.

Explain what you’re using, and how it’s helped you. I really appreciate this - messages like these give me joy and keep me motivated!

### Donating money

I'm fortunate to not need donations, but open source has small running costs e.g. hosting and a few paid tools. If you want to chip in, I won't say no.
