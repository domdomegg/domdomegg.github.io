<Details title='Donate on my behalf'>

Donate to the [Against Malaria Foundation](https://www.againstmalaria.com/donate.aspx?IsGift=1) on my behalf. Enter my email from my homepage as the gift recipient.

You might do this because:
* Not all countries and currencies are supported by the methods above, particularly sanctioned countries.
* Paying me might create an apparent conflict of interest. If you’re not sure this would apply, ask me beforehand.
