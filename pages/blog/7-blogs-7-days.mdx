I’m setting myself a challenge: write 7 blog articles that I’m proud of in 7 days.

And no, this one doesn’t count.

## Why?

There are three main reasons:

* to get better at writing quickly, while maintaining quality
* to clear a backlog of ideas for articles, which has now grown to 40 articles I’d like to write!
* because I’ve taken a week off work, so have more time available than normal

‘Maintaining quality’ is obviously highly subjective. Properties I value in my writing currently are:[^1]

* honesty: saying things that I fully believe in, and being explicit when I’m not sure about something. This includes not omitting material points, or writing anything intentionally misleading.
* verifiability: readers shouldn’t just have to trust that I’m honest all the time. It should be easy for them to check my claims, should I be relying on some evidence that can be corroborated.
* clarity: making it easy to read my articles even if you’re not an expert in some area. This involves using simple language, consistent terms, and linking to relevant further reading.
* importance: write things I think could matter to someone, and ideally for decisions that are important. It’s fine if that someone is future me, or some audience who I don’t know yet but reasonably expect to exist. This usually means there needs to be something novel about each article.[^2] There’s no point just regurgitating content already out there, or easily generated by today’s AI systems.
Provided I get the articles written, at the end of the week I’ll review them for quality along these axes.

See you in a week!

[^1]: There are other qualities that I’d like to have in my writing, but that I don't see as critical: humour in particular. If people have advice on this, [I’d love to hear it](/).

[^2]: The idea or topic itself doesn’t need to be novel: the presentation might be novel instead. For example, great textbooks rarely present new ideas, but do present ideas in a new way that’s easier to digest.
