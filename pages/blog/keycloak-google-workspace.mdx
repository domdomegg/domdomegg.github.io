title: "How to send Keycloak emails through Google Workspace's SMTP relay"

To support [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/)'s standard email verification and password reset flows, you'll need to configure an SMTP connection.

If you already have a [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/) account, you can set up a free SMTP relay in a few minutes. As well as saving you from having to set up a separate SMTP service, this also means that you get all the benefits of your existing email setup from Google Workspace such as DKIM signing.

## Google Workspace setup

As a Google Workspace admin:

1. In the admin console, go to [Apps > Google Workspace > Gmail > Routing](https://admin.google.com/ac/apps/gmail/routing).
2. Go to the 'SMTP relay service' section, and click 'Add rule'
3. Set the following settings:
    - Allowed senders: Only addresses in my domains
    - Authentication: Require SMTP Authentication (specific IP optional)
    - Encryption: Require TLS encryption

As any Google Workspace account:[^1]

1. In your account settings, go to [Security > 2-Step Verification > App passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
2. Create a new app password, and copy this value[^2]

## Keycloak setup

In the admin console:

1. Go to Realm settings > Email
2. In the Template section, set the 'From' address to `anything@yourdomain.com`
3. In the Connection & Authentication section, set:
    - Host: `smtp-relay.gmail.com`
    - Port: `587`
    - Encryption: Enable StartTLS
    - Authentication: Enabled
    - Username: The account associated with the app password you copied earlier, e.g. `keycloak-svc@yourdomain.com`.
    - Password: The app password you copied earlier.

[^1]: Preferably use a service account so it doesn't break when someone leaves the company, e.g. `keycloak-svc@yourdomain.com`. Emails don't need to be sent from this account, e.g. `keycloak-svc@yourdomain.com` can send as `noreply@yourdomain.com` with no further setup.
[^2]: The spaces don't matter, as in they can be included or excluded. [Presumably](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/10750/how-does-google-not-care-about-spaces-in-application-specific-passwords) Google strips them when authenticating.
