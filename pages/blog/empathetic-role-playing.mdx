User interviews are the gold standard for understanding your users and their problems. However, interviews are expensive and time-consuming for lower-stakes decisions, and some organisations make it difficult to do them. This article introduces *empathetic role-playing*, a less powerful but cheaper alternative to user interviews.

This isn’t a new technique! It’s just a thing I’ve seen some of the best product people I’ve worked with at Palantir and Starling Bank do, but I haven’t seen a description of it written down anywhere.

## What is empathetic role-playing?

Empathetic role-playing is where you simulate a scenario from the perspective of a user. It’s a bit of a cross between [empathy mapping](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/empathy-mapping/), [journey mapping](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/journey-mapping-101/), and [role-playing](https://servicedesigntools.org/tools/role-playing).

The process is:

1. Imagine you are a customer who has a problem.
2. Write down what would you think and feel in this situation.
3. Identify what you’d do next.
4. Imagine taking that step, and what is the likely result?
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the problem is solved or you get to a dead end.

### When is empathetic role-playing appropriate?

Empathetic role-playing is likely to lead to best results if:

* You’re deeply familiar with the people you’re trying to help. It’s ideal if you are in the target demographic yourself.
* You have strong empathy skills.[^1]

### How to make the most of empathetic role-playing

Don’t just simulate the [happy path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path)! People have complex lives - perhaps there are constraints such as:

- they have limited time or money to pursue a solution
- they work a job so aren’t free to call during business hours
- they have social anxiety and don’t want to talk to a stranger about their problem

To make things even more realistic, do step 4 for real where possible. For example, if this is setting up a free account with another provider, go through that flow.

## Deciding between tools

In general your decision of what tool to use should be based on trading off these two factors:

* **How costly is each option?** This includes staff time setting up and running interviews, any incentives given to customers, and other costs (for example, political capital in some backwards organisations).
* **What is the expected benefit from each option?** This is usually by avoiding spending money building the wrong product, which is very expensive. You also need to evaluate the likelihood of discovering that you were building the wrong thing. If you haven’t done user interviews before, you are almost certainly overestimating how well you know your customers and undervaluing this.

You also don’t need to commit to one tool from the outset. For example, you might start with empathetic role-playing, discover a critical uncertainty, and then switch to user interviewing to resolve that uncertainty.

## Concluding

Empathetic role-playing is a hugely useful technique for those occasions where a full set of user interviews isn’t practical, but you’re not calibrated enough to immediately make judgement calls. Try putting it into practice in your next project and see how it goes!

    I haven’t found excellent resources on developing empathy as a skill. Many articles on this are very vague. [This article](https://mcc.gse.harvard.edu/resources-for-educators/how-build-empathy-strengthen-school-community) seems to be one of the better ones.

    An idea I have for a training program on this is a series of flashcards, each with a description of some people in a scenario. The learner then has to guess how people are feeling, what they might do next and why. Large language models might be quite good at this due to how they’re trained to predict what will happen next. They therefore might be able to generate scenarios and grade answers well.
