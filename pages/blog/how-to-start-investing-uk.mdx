As a bit of a personal finance nerd, people often ask me where to start with investing. I find myself giving the same core advice repeatedly.

**The biggest and most common mistake I've seen is not starting to invest.** People often put off managing their finances, or get stuck in analysis paralysis. They discover there are a bunch of different types of ways to invest, things to invest in, and it all seems a bit confusing. And there are few really practical guides that will be opinionated about what exactly to do.

This guide will get you past this hurdle by telling you how to get started.

_Disclaimer: While I am reasonably confident in these suggestions for most people, I am not a financial adviser and am not liable for your investment decisions. Don't sue me if you're not a millionaire in a few years!_

## Are you ready to invest?

This guide is for you if you:
- have enough money to cover your essential expenses for 3 months (an emergency fund) - if not, build this first
- don't have high interest debt - pay this off first instead
- have between £100 and £250,000 to invest
- can put away the money for at least 12 months
- have a mostly 'normal' tax situation (e.g. you're a UK or EU citizen, living in the UK for tax purposes)
- understand investments can you up and down, and (although it's unlikely) you could get back less than you put in

## Getting started

The simplest and most effective approach for most people is to invest in low-cost index funds through an ISA (Individual Savings Account). To do this:

1. Set up an ISA with [iWeb Share Dealing](https://www.iweb-sharedealing.co.uk/)
2. Add money to your ISA, and buy a low-cost index fund
    - Recommended: GB00B7W4GQ69 FTSE 100 tracker (MYKAAB)
      <Details title='What do I click to do this?'>
      Once you've logged into your iWeb account:
      1. Click 'Fund this account' on your **Stocks and Shares ISA account**, and add money with your debit card.
      2. Click 'Deal now' on your **Stocks and Shares ISA account**.
      3. Change the option to 'Funds', paste in `GB00B7W4GQ69` and click the 'Verify' button.
      4. For some funds, change the option to 'UK & ETFs' and paste the code in there instead.
      5. Enter in the amount - probably just everything you put in, then click continue.
      6. Give the key investor document a skim, and if happy place the order.
      </Details>

There are a lot of options here, but the above should suit most beginners to start with. You don't need to read the toggles below unless you're interested.

<Details title='Why iWeb Share Dealing?'>
I recommend iWeb because:
- They have some of [the lowest fees in the UK](https://monevator.com/compare-uk-cheapest-online-brokers/). It's completely free to just hold stocks there.
    <Details title='Do fees of 1% or 2% really matter?'>
    Yes! Because these fees compound, it can significantly affect your investment returns.

    Just like how the power of investing is in compound growth, having compounded fees eats a lot into your portfolio.

    [This article](https://www.performanceig.com/fees-matter) shows the difference between a 1% fee and 3% fee over 30 years changes a ~$5M pot into a ~$3M pot!
    </Details>
- They allow you to invest in pretty much whatever you want, which gives you flexibility later.
- Their platform is simple and doesn't try to encourage frequent trading.
- They're trustworthy as part of [Lloyds Banking Group](https://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are/our-brands/iweb.html) and are [regulated by the FCA](https://register.fca.org.uk/s/firm?id=001b000000MfHYVAA3).

You're not locked in - you can open multiple ISAs across different providers later, and transfer your investments between them if you want (although the transfer process can be slow-ish). You can only put up to [the ISA limit](https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts) each year across your ISAs - you're responsible for making sure you don't go over this if you have multiple ISAs.

If you do go with another provider, make sure that:
- they are on [the FCA register](https://register.fca.org.uk/s/)
- you understand the fees they will charge
</Details>

<Details title='Am I protected if my ISA provider goes bust?'>
In general, yes if they are FCA regulated.

Two things are in place to handle this scenario:
- Segregation of Assets: Your investments are kept separate from the provider's own assets. So if the provider goes bust, all your investments should still be there. iWeb [explains how they achieve this on their website](https://www.iweb-sharedealing.co.uk/ics-service.html).
- FSCS compensation: If something has gone very wrong and assets have not been kept separate, the government-backed [Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS)](https://www.fscs.org.uk/) guarantees up to £85,000 (and sometimes more). This is done on a per-bank basis - so plausibly with iWeb that means if you also had an account with Lloyds Bank only a total of £85,000 would be reimbursed for both.

Note that this protection is about the ISA provider failing - it doesn't protect you against your investments losing value through normal market movements.
</Details>

<Details title='What is an ISA, and why should I open it?'>
You can make investments in a general investment account without an ISA. However, any [profits ('capital gains') you make will be taxed by the government](https://www.gov.uk/capital-gains-tax).

An ISA (Individual Savings Account) is just the name for an investment account where you don't have to pay tax on the profits. The government set these up to encourage people to save money.

The one limitation is that you can only put so much into your ISAs each tax year. In the 2024-2025 tax year, this limit was £20,000/year, but you can [find the updated limit on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts). Once the money is in your ISA, it can grow beyond this limit, and you can add to it every tax year.

There's essentially no downside to using an ISA compared to a regular investment account, so you should always use your ISA allowance first.
</Details>

<Details title='What about a cash ISA / lifetime ISA / help-to-by ISA / innovative finance ISA?'>
iWeb's ISA is a stocks & shares ISA. This gives you a lot of flexibility, and you can use it to invest in shares, trusts, funds (including ETFs), and bonds. These investments can go up or down, but over many years they tend to go up - for example, the FTSE100 [returned on average 6.3% per year from 2003 to 2023](https://www.ig.com/uk/trading-strategies/what-are-the-average-returns-of-the-ftse-100--230511).

Cash ISAs are similar to a bank savings account: they offer lower returns, in exchange for more safety. Most give you a fixed interest rate, and your money can only go up. Over the past 10 years, these have usually offered rates of 0.5-2%. As of December 2024, these have risen to rates of up to 5% due to inflation, but it is expected that these will drop soon.

> If you want the benefits of a guaranteed rate, you can also get this by [buying a cash fund (also known as a money market fund) in your stocks & shares ISA](https://www.ii.co.uk/analysis-commentary/highest-yielding-money-market-funds-park-your-cash-ii527664). In my opinion this makes cash ISAs a little redundant.

Lifetime ISAs are stocks & shares or cash ISAs that offer a 25% government bonus on money you put in, but are much more restrictive. You can only put £4,000 per year into them, and can only spend them on your first home or retirement. Fewer providers offer lifetime ISAs, so fees tend to be higher. These can be good if you have clear plans on how to use them, but if you're unsure I'd recommend to defaulting to a standard stocks & shares ISA.

Help-to-Buy ISAs are no longer available to new savers, but were similar to lifetime ISAs.

Innovative finance ISAs are similar to stocks & shares ISAs, but allow you to make weirder more risky investments. This includes peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding. There are limited providers who offer them, they're more complex, and they tend to be higher risk (without good evidence of delivering a higher return). As such, I think beginners should usually avoid them.

<Details title="Shouldn't I wait until <event> to invest?">
Predicting the market is really hard. If you really are able to accurately predict the market, you should be earning millions at a hedge fund. At this point you should get independent financial advice on your investments.

Even if you had perfect information about when the market will crash, [you'll still make less money trying to time it](https://www.personalfinanceclub.com/how-to-perfectly-time-the-market/).
</Details>

<Details title='What is an index fund, and why buy a low-cost index fund?'>
An index is just a list of companies. E.g. FTSE100 is the largest 100 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange (originally set up as a collaboration between the **F**inancial **T**imes and the London **S**tock **E**xchange, hence **FTSE**).

A fund is a group of people bringing their money together to invest.

An index fund is therefore a group of people bringing their money together to buy shares in a list of companies. You might also hear index funds called 'passive' funds because they just follow whatever the index says, without 'active' management by fund managers picking individual stocks.

<Details title='Why not buy active funds?'>
Most studies show that [active funds are no better than a monkey picking random stocks](https://www.rock-wealth.co.uk/monkeys-beat-money-managers-at-selling-stocks/). Index funds perform just as well, and are usually more diversified and have lower fees so are better in practice.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvGLnthJDsg) also explains why active funds are usually a mistake.

<Details title='Why not buy active funds that have been consistently performing well?'>
Imagine getting a 1024 people to flip a coin 10 times. By chance, we should expect one person to get 10 heads in a row.

Wow! They must be really lucky, right? Should we bet on them flipping heads again? Probably not.

There are thousands of funds at any given time. The same logic applies here: where you would expect high-performing funds by chance, even if they were all just random.

This is part of what finance people mean when they say "past performance is not indicative of future results".

(Note: There are probably some people who can beat the market consistently. However, the funds these people usually manage are not open to retail investors, or the fees for these funds are greater than the extra returns.)
</Details>
</Details>

Companies like Blackrock and Vanguard manage these index funds. For example, they buy and sell the company shares when people join and leave the fund or companies move on and off the list. This work takes them time, and so they charge a management fee for this work. Because they're buying based on the index, the main point of comparison is just who charges a lower cost for their management fee - making low-cost index funds most effective.

<Details title='Do fees of 1% or 2% really matter?'>
Yes! Because these fees compound, it can significantly affect your investment returns.

Just like how the power of investing is in compound growth, having compounded fees eats a lot into your portfolio.

[This article](https://www.performanceig.com/fees-matter) shows the difference between a 1% fee and 3% fee over 30 years changes a ~$5M pot into a ~$3M pot!
</Details>
</Details>

<Details title='What other low-cost index funds might I want to invest in?'>
_If you're unsure, start with the FTSE 100. This tracks big companies in the UK and is suitable for most people. You can always change where you allocate your money in future - remember the biggest mistake is not starting!_

When choosing funds, look for "Acc" or accumulating versions. These automatically reinvest any dividends, maximizing the power of compound growth over time. Only choose income funds if you specifically need regular payouts, like during retirement.

Other good options for low-cost index funds are:
- FTSE250 if you think medium-big companies in the UK will do well. GB00B7W4GQ69 (VMIG)
- S&P500 if you think big companies in the US will do well. IE00BFMXXD54 (VUAG).
- NASDAQ100 if you think tech companies in the US will do well. IE0032077012 (EQQQ).

The reason I've picked the specific these funds is because
1. they're allowed to be held in a UK ISA;
2. these trackers represent the most common things people want to track; and
3. they have low fees.

If you find other accumulating trackers for the same indexes with lower fees these are probably good too.
</Details>

<Details title='Should I spread my investment across different index funds?'>
Diversification is good! Index funds are already a fairly diversified investment (over picking individual companies), so for the beginner you probably don't need to do this.

As you start to invest more, you can split up your money between some of the indexes. I'd probably recommend only doing this if you're putting in at least £2,000 per fund, because otherwise the transaction fees can get pricey.
</Details>

<Details title='What about crypto (including NFTs) / art / gold?'>
- Crypto is highly volatile, largely unregulated, and difficult to get good diversification in. It is also complex, which has led to many crypto scams floating around. As a beginner, I would tread with caution.
- Art requires specialist knowledge and usually needs large amounts of money to invest meaningfully. [Online platforms that offer fractional art investing tend not to go well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ojOkPmm8lw).
- Gold can be useful to hedge against certain risks. You can buy funds that track gold (or other precious metals) in your iWeb ISA.

All of these assets are not inherently productive or income generating. By this, I mean that you expect a company to be worth more in the future: it's genuinely investing in something that you expect to produce goods and services and make a profit. However, most crypto assets, art and gold are not productive - the main benefit is that they might stay stable, not grow.

For most people starting out, these shouldn't make up a significant amount of your investment portfolio. Stick to broad market index funds until you have more experience and a solid foundation.
</Details>

<Details title='What about premium bonds?'>
Premium Bonds are a government-backed savings product with a £50,000 maximum investment. Like ISAs, they're tax-free, but typically offer lower returns than investing in the stock market.

You might want to buy premium bonds if:
- You want a completely safe place to store money and the expected return beats available cash ISA rates; or
- You've already used up your yearly ISA allowance and want another tax-free savings option (if the rates they offer are greater than the best other savings accounts rates after tax)
</Details>

<Details title='What if I have more than the maximum ISA limit to invest?'>
First, put as much as you can into your ISA.

Then, make your remaining investments in your 'Share Dealing Account'. This is automatically created when you open an iWeb ISA. You can invest in this in the exact same way as your ISA, although you'll need to pay capital gains tax on some of your profits when you sell.

Alternatively, you can put money into premium bonds for a tax-free savings mechanism. However, as the interest rate is usually lower you'd want to trade the tax savings off against this.
</Details>

<Details title='Why should I trust your recommendations?'>
I expect many people landing here to be people who trust me, that I've recommended here. If you don't know me, you _should_ be very skeptical of random people giving out financial advice on the internet!

You should seek out financial advice from other people you trust (and seem competent). Advocates of the low-cost index fund strategy include:
- [Warren Buffet](https://youtu.be/kqfMvHufOMk?feature=shared&t=9)
- [Charlie Munger](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-munger-said-401-k-141526942.html)
- [Jack Bogle](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/famous-investors/john-bogle/)
- [Ben Felix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvGLnthJDsg), an influencer in the personal finance space who is a licensed portfolio manager.

I don't recieve anything for recommending the above platform or investments - these are just my good faith best recommendations.
</Details>

<Details title='What if I need more help?'>
You can get free finance advice, including talking to a human about ISAs and investments, from the [UK Government's Money Helper service](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/).

This is not regulated financial advice though. For that, you'll need to pay a professional - what you're looking for is an 'independent financial advisor' who is listed on [the FCA register](https://register.fca.org.uk/s/). [unbiased](https://www.unbiased.co.uk/advisers?service=financial-adviser) is a directory of these advisors.
</Details>

## Investing more money

Over time, you can also add more money to your investments, up to the ISA limits. The process to fund your account and purchase more stocks is the same as above.

<Details title='What if I have more than the maximum ISA limit to invest?'>
First, put as much as you can into your ISA.

Then, make your remaining investments in your 'Share Dealing Account'. This is automatically created when you open an iWeb ISA. You can invest in this in the exact same way as your ISA, although you'll need to pay capital gains tax on some of your profits when you sell.

Alternatively, you can put money into premium bonds for a tax-free savings mechanism. However, as the interest rate is usually lower you'd want to trade the tax savings off against this.

<Details title='What are premium bonds?'>
Premium Bonds are a government-backed savings product with a £50,000 maximum investment. Like ISAs, they're tax-free, but typically offer lower returns than investing in the stock market.

You might want to buy premium bonds if:
- You want a completely safe place to store money and the expected return beats available cash ISA rates; or
- You've already used up your yearly ISA allowance and want another tax-free savings option (if the rates they offer are greater than the best other savings accounts rates after tax)
</Details>
</Details>

## Not doing anything else

Now: **don't do anything else**.

It's tempting to obsessively check how your investments are performing, and think about moving them around. It's doubly tempting when the stock market is moving around a lot, or you've got a flashy app to track things.

However, the next biggest mistake after not investing is selling when your stocks go down. This is the default human reaction, but it's the wrong one. If the stocks go down 20% and you sell, you're effectively selling your stocks to a buyer at a 20% discount! [Timing is hard](https://www.personalfinanceclub.com/how-to-perfectly-time-the-market/).

It may be useful to do a financial review every now and then. I'd recommend looking at your investment performance at least every 12 months, but no more than once a month. You should rarely consider selling unless you need the money, but it can be useful for planning out other financial decisions you might want to make.

## Cashing out

Hopefully if you've followed these instructions you'll have a big investment pot! And one day you'll want to use that money.

When you need your money, selling your investments is straightforward - just sell through the website and the money will reach your bank account in 1-2 days.

Note: Once you withdraw money from your ISA, you can only put back in up to your annual ISA allowance (currently £20,000). So think carefully before making large withdrawals, as you might not be able to put all the money back in later.
