This was a section on my homepage, as part of a [How to work with me manual](https://medium.com/swlh/user-manual-to-me-92c8ce68f960) / [User Guide](https://lg.substack.com/p/the-looking-glass-a-user-guide-to). I ended up extracting it here to reduce clutter there, and make it easier to reference directly.

_Note: Don't worry too much about following these exactly! Details here are mostly relevant for people I work with a lot or [AI virtual collaborators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snkOMOjiVOk&t=932s)._

## From you to me

- **Bias towards overcommunicating.** Leave pauses so I can interrupt you if you're telling me stuff I don't think is relevant.
- **State your uncertainties** and where you've made assumptions.
- **Give me [feedback](/feedback/).** Prefer unpolished timely feedback to no or late feedback. Bonus points if you can be specific or provide examples.
- **If you're asking me to review something,** see my [review guide](/blog/reviewing-your-work/).
- **Generally prefers async communication (email, Slack, docs) over unplanned calls, and appreciate clear action items and timelines.**
  - **Exception:** if we are colleagues and something is blocking you.
- **Asynchronous communications**
  - **Slack** if we have a workspace in common relevant to the topic, you know I check that workspace, and it's something short.
  - **WhatsApp, Messenger or Telegram** for personal stuff (no formal work comms).
    - Exception: If we're working somewhere that doesn't have a communication tool, you can send work comms here.
  - **Google Docs or similar** for anything longer or that needs collaboration.
  - **Email** for everything else, or where you're not sure.
  - It's fine for you to send me asynchronous communications while sitting next to me.
  - **If you need me to do or answer something, make it obvious.** For example:
    - Add '[Action required]' to the subject.
    - Prefix tasks with 'Action required:' and bold them.
    - State any relevant timelines upfront.
  - **If I need to read it,** use the email 'to' line or tag my Slack handle.
  - **Don't [inline reply](https://ssw.com.au/rules/email-avoid-inline/) to emails.** It's hard to see what's been added, muddies email history, and causes difficult-to-resolve forks.
  - **[Don't just say hello](https://nohello.net/).**
  - **Prefer to communicate widely** (e.g. Slack channels/email distros, not DMs) so others can learn from our conversation later.
    - Exception: discussions about personal or sensitive matters
- **Synchronous communications**
  - **Likes:** In person, or [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/).

## From me to you

- I don't usually send acknowledgement messages unless asked.
- **[Assume misunderstanding, not malice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor) in my comms.** In particular:
  - If I'm going in the wrong direction, tell me early.
  - I tend to overcommunicate to ensure we're aligned. Interrupt me if I'm telling you something you know!
  - If I am slow to respond, I'm likely a bit overloaded with other stuff.
- **I will send you asynchronous communications while sitting next to you,** unless you ask me not to. This is to avoid interrupting you, and so that you can instead address comments at a time that is convenient to you.
- **Emoji meanings:** üëÄ is 'looking', ‚úÖ is 'done', üëç is 'acknowledged' ([not meant passive aggressively](https://www.cnet.com/culture/internet/gen-z-youll-have-to-pry-the-hostile-thumbs-up-emoji-from-my-old-dead-hands/)), ‚ûï is 'agreed', üôå or üéâ is 'yay'
