As of April 2025, at least 300,000 people work directly on creating training data for AI systems. This is roughly comparable to a small island nation - between Barbados and Vanuatu.

The true number is likely higher, as it seems like many of these statistics might be a year out of date. My guess would be the true number is something like 400,000 to 500,000: between Iceland and Malta.

This is the total number of contractors, many of whom will be part-time. I have not attempted to evaluate the full-time equivalents of these.

## Providers

### Scale AI

[Scale AI](https://scale.com/), which provides training data for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Deepmind and Meta[^1], has hired people under the [Remotasks](https://www.remotasks.com/en) and [Outlier](https://outlier.ai/) brands. From their websites they have hired:

* Remotasks: “240,000+ total taskers”
* Outlier: “40,000 experts”

These numbers do seem accurate, based on:

* Conversations I’ve had with some people who contract for Scale. They said a few Slack groups[^2] they were added to had hundreds of thousands of members (but they’ve since been moved to Discourse).
* [A June 2024 article by The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-a-14-billion-startup-is-now-hiring-phds-to-train-ai-from-their-living-rooms) said “About 300,000 [taskers] take assignments through a Slack group run by Outlier, a Scale subsidiary”. The article suggests this might also be from inside sources.
* The [unofficial outlier subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/outlier_ai/) has 44k members. This suggests Outlier must have a lot more contractors than 40,000 given not all of them will have joined the subreddit.

All these estimates are several months old - and the websites have not been updated for a while (based on internet archive snapshots). I expect the true numbers to be higher with the increased investment going into AI.

### Prolific

[Prolific](https://www.prolific.com/data-annotation) claims to have “200,000+ active taskers” for AI data annotation projects. However it’s unclear whether these are actually all working on AI projects as prolific does a range of different data work.

The [unofficial Prolific subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProlificAc/) has 43k members.

### Surge AI

[Surge AI](https://www.surgehq.ai/), operating under the [DataAnnotation](https://www.dataannotation.tech/) brand, say they have “100k+ Members”. They hire contractors in the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, UK, and Ireland, and [work with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind](https://www.surgehq.ai/customers).

The [unofficial subreddit has 31k members](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataannotation/), which supports this scale claim.

### LabelBox

[LabelBox](https://labelbox.com/), operating under the brand [Alignner](https://www.alignerr.com/) has an unofficial subreddit with [14k members](https://www.reddit.com/r/alignerr/). They hire contractors in the USA, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

I did not find a public claim from them about number of taskers, but we can estimate this using their subreddit numbers. We can use the claimed taskers to redditor ratios for Prolific (4.7 taskers/redditor) and Surge AI (3.2 taskers/redditor) and assume it’s about the same here for number of taskers - maybe 4 taskers/redditor. This results in 56k estimated taskers.

## Aggregating the above

Summing the above gets us about 280k + 200k + 100k + 56k = 636k taskers.

However, it’s likely that many contractors sign up to multiple platforms. The most conservative estimate would therefore say that we should take the maximum rather than sum here - pointing towards Scale AI with 280,000 contractors.

In practice not every contractor will also have registered with Scale AI - and Scale’s public numbers are likely an underestimate for the reasons above. I think this gives us at least 300k as a lower bound. My best guess is 400k-500k.
